1.  **Consistent Formatting:** Adopt a consistent format for each work experience entry (Company, Role, Dates, Bullet Points of Achievements).  Use action verbs to start each bullet point and quantify achievements whenever possible (e.g., "Improved efficiency by 15%," "Reduced costs by $X").

2.  **Keyword Optimization:** Analyze job descriptions for target roles and incorporate relevant keywords throughout the resume.  This will improve ATS compatibility.

3.  **Quantify Achievements:**  Add quantifiable results to each bullet point to demonstrate the impact of your contributions.  For example, instead of "Worked on migration of Hana DB," write "Successfully migrated Hana DB from Azure to GCP, resulting in a 10% reduction in database latency."
