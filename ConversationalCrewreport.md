Hi there! It's exciting you're starting your career journey in Bangalore!  With zero years of experience, you have a fantastic opportunity to explore various fields. To best guide you, tell me a bit more about yourself and what you're hoping to achieve. What are your career aspirations? What kind of work excites you?  What are your strengths and interests?  Don't worry about having a perfectly defined path yet â€“ many successful women started with similar uncertainty. For example, did you know that Indra Nooyi, former CEO of PepsiCo, initially pursued a career in academics before transitioning to the corporate world?  Her journey shows that a clear path isn't always necessary at the beginning.  Once I understand your interests, I can help you explore potential career paths, relevant skills to learn, and even resources like online courses or job boards in Bangalore.  Are you interested in learning more about job opportunities or skill development resources?  Perhaps you'd like me to help you brainstorm ideas for your resume as you start applying for jobs?
