AI: That's fantastic that you're starting your job search as a soon-to-be B.Tech graduate!  Finding the right first role can be exciting, but also a little daunting.

I found one job posting that *might* be a good fit, but keep in mind that it does require a bit more experience than you currently have.  It's worth considering if you're open to roles that offer on-the-job learning and development.

Here's the opportunity:

* **Job Title:** Software Test Engineer
* **Company:** LendingTree
* **Location:** Charlotte, NC (Hybrid - in-office required Tuesday-Thursday)
* **Application URL:** https://wellfound.com/jobs/3271235-software-test-engineer?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic
* **Years of Experience:** 3+ years in Software Testing, 2+ years automation (or M.S. in CS and relevant experience)
* **Skills Required:** Java or C# (or similar), Web & Mobile app testing, SQL/NoSQL databases, Git, experience with web services.


Even if this specific role isn't the perfect match right now, don't be discouraged!  To find more opportunities tailored to your experience level, consider broadening your search.  Think about:

* **Targeting entry-level positions:**  Many companies offer great entry-level roles for recent graduates.  Look for keywords like "graduate," "entry-level," "junior," or "associate."
* **Focusing on specific skills:** Highlight the skills you *do* have in your resume and cover letter, even if they're not explicitly listed in every job description.
* **Exploring different job boards:**  Use multiple job search websites and company career pages to expand your reach.
* **Networking:**  Connect with people in your field through LinkedIn or university alumni networks.  Informational interviews can be incredibly valuable.


Remember, your first job is a stepping stone.  Focus on finding a role that allows you to learn and grow, and you'll be well on your way to a successful career!

AI: Hi there! It's exciting you're starting your career journey in Bangalore!  With zero years of experience, you have a fantastic opportunity to explore various fields. To best guide you, tell me a bit more about yourself and what you're hoping to achieve. What are your career aspirations? What kind of work excites you?  What are your strengths and interests?  Don't worry about having a perfectly defined path yet – many successful women started with similar uncertainty. For example, did you know that Indra Nooyi, former CEO of PepsiCo, initially pursued a career in academics before transitioning to the corporate world?  Her journey shows that a clear path isn't always necessary at the beginning.  Once I understand your interests, I can help you explore potential career paths, relevant skills to learn, and even resources like online courses or job boards in Bangalore.  Are you interested in learning more about job opportunities or skill development resources?  Perhaps you'd like me to help you brainstorm ideas for your resume as you start applying for jobs?
