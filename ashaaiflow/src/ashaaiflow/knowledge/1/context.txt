* **Action Verbs:**  Using stronger action verbs to begin bullet points will make the descriptions more impactful (e.g., "Developed" instead of "Worked on").
* **Keywords Optimization:** While the key skills section is comprehensive, strategically incorporating relevant keywords throughout the resume (especially in the experience section) will improve ATS compatibility.
* **Career Summary Refinement:** The profile section could be more impactful.  Instead of simply stating skills, it should highlight career aspirations and value proposition.  For example, it could focus on a specific area of Gen AI or Machine Learning she wants to specialize in.
* **Consistency in Tense:** Maintain consistent tense (past tense for completed projects and past participles for ongoing projects) for better readability.


**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Resume Formatting:** Use a clean and modern template.  Consider using a two-column layout to improve readability.  Ensure consistent font sizes and styles.
2. **Quantify Achievements:**  Add quantifiable results to each bullet point in the experience section.  For example, instead of "Worked on migration of Hana DB from Azure to GCP," write "Successfully migrated Hana DB from Azure to GCP, resulting in a 20% reduction in database latency."
3. **Strengthen Action Verbs:** Replace weak verbs with stronger action verbs.
4. **Keyword Optimization:** Research keywords relevant to target job roles and incorporate them naturally throughout the resume.  Use tools like LinkedIn's job description analysis to identify relevant keywords.
5. **Refine Career Summary:** Rewrite the profile section to highlight career goals and value proposition.  Focus on a specific area of expertise within Gen AI or Machine Learning.
6. **Tailor to Specific Roles:**  Customize the resume for each job application, highlighting the skills and experiences most relevant to the specific role.
7. **Proofread Carefully:**  Thoroughly proofread the resume for any grammatical errors or typos.


**Example of Improved Bullet Point:**

**Original:**  "Worked on building Rule Editor Component using SAPUI5"

**Improved:** "Developed and implemented a Rule Editor Component using SAPUI5, resulting in a 10% increase in user efficiency and a 5% reduction in error rates."


By implementing these suggestions, Vidhi can significantly enhance her resume's effectiveness, making it more appealing to recruiters and increasing her chances of securing her desired roles.  Remember to highlight her contributions to women in tech and any initiatives she's involved in to further showcase her value.
