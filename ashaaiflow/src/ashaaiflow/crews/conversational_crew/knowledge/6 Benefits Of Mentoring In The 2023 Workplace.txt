Good news first: 76% of employees think mentorship is important. The not-so-good-news? Only 37% of employees have a mentor.

Mentorship is a dynamic relationship where a more experienced employee provides guidance, support and knowledge to a less experienced employee. This relationship is built on mutual respect, trust and open communication.


There are many benefits to mentoring. Here are six to consider.

1. Boost employee engagement and productivity.
Think about a time when a teacher provided you with one-to-one assistance on a topic. Your interest levels were piqued, right? Similarly, the individualized assistance that mentoring provides boosts employees' engagement with their work. In turn, higher engagement levels help mentees develop fresh perspectives and improve problem-solving and productivity.

Mentoring benefits aren’t limited to mentees. Mentors have opportunities to learn, too. Some of the knowledge and techniques they bring may be outdated, so mentees can help their mentors unlearn them. Mentees can also provide a fresh way of thinking about old problems. Lastly, mentors may receive guidance on better use of the latest technologies in their field to be more productive with their time.
2. Improve employee retention.
Workplace trends of the past few years have revealed that employees want to work at companies that help them build their skills because it shows investment in their careers. Mentorship programs facilitate skill-building and continuous learning in a way few other initiatives do. The process also builds bonds that encourage employees to stay with the company for a longer period of time because they feel valued and supported.

With years of experience in their field, mentors can easily identify which skills a mentee needs to hone and which strengths to leverage. It's only when an employee knows where they’re at that they can begin their journey of self-improvement. Then, the mentor can show ways to build skills quickly and efficiently, like inviting mentees to participate in a project or helping them identify opportunities within the company. This makes for efficient learning compared to other less interactive modes of improvement, like watching training videos.


3. Build a culture of knowledge sharing and collaboration.
Mentoring is a medium for employees to share their knowledge and experiences. Mentees receive vital knowledge and perspectives as mentors impart their ideas and best practices, which help employees tackle their obstacles skillfully.
Mentoring also encourages cross-departmental cooperation, dismantles silos and fosters a culture of ongoing learning. When an individual is selected as a mentor, it shows the organization sees them as an expert at their work. This recognition enhances the mentor's reputation within the organization. It also encourages more employees, both within and outside their department, to seek their advice, leading to cross-functional collaboration.
4. Develop high-performing employees and a leadership pipeline.
During mentorship, employees often receive constructive criticism and feedback. The coaching provided by mentors helps mentees develop their skills quickly. This can help them get promoted faster. As one 2020 survey showed, those who had the opportunity to be mentored were five times more likely to be promoted.
As mentees learn industry best practices and tried-and-tested strategies, their performance and capabilities soar. These employees become high-performing assets for the company. Ultimately, this helps companies recognize and cultivate potential leaders. By assisting employees every step of the way, mentors support the development of a pipeline of future leaders.
5. Build a healthy work environment.
Mentorship helps the paired employees develop close bonds. Mentors share their stories and experiences, while mentees discuss their personal life and goals. Such conversations lead to developing mutual trust and respect. Ultimately, it leads to a more welcoming work environment for all employees.
As a Workplace Happiness Survey found, nine in 10 employees with a career mentor feel happy at work. They're more likely to report being well compensated and to feel like their contributions are recognized—important factors in overall job satisfaction.
6. Increase company profitability.
Nearly 70% of businesses reported an increase in productivity due to mentoring, and more than 50% say these programs had a positive impact on profits. Mentoring helps increase employee engagement and productivity, which boosts profitability for companies.
3 Ways To Improve Your Mentoring Initiatives
A mentoring program isn’t a one-and-done exercise. For it to be effective, you need to carefully plan, monitor and measure its impact. After all, you roll out mentorship initiatives for a reason, whether it’s to improve employee engagement, retention or productivity. Here are some ways to strengthen your mentoring initiatives.
1. Outline the goal.
Your mentoring program can quickly go astray unless it’s built toward a goal. Before you open the floor for mentorship, pinpoint the organizational need you want the program to fulfill. Do you want to increase inter-departmental collaboration, attract and retain top talent or fill skills gaps? Whatever the goal, you need to outline it in order to bring mentors and mentees together in a way that will achieve the impact you want.
2. Get buy-in from company leaders.
With leadership support, a mentoring program gets the internal endorsement it needs. Whether it’s budget, sponsorship or internal promotions, mentoring initiatives can fall flat without executive buy-in. Create a mentoring program proposal and present the benefits, including how it can help achieve organizational goals, so higher-ups see the business value of mentoring.
3. Use technology to implement your mentoring program.
A common criticism of mentorship programs is that sometimes divergent personalities can be put together. Such pairings could increase friction between employees and even within the company. One solution to this is using tech tools, such as mentoring software, to automate the management of your initiative. It can streamline match-ups based on factors such as skill set, location and experience, making mentor-mentee pairings that accelerate employee development.
An effective mentoring program helps employees—both mentors and mentees—become the best versions of themselves. As more productive assets, they can boost overall productivity and business success.
