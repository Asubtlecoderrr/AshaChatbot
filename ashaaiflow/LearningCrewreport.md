There is no single "best" way to learn Python, as the optimal approach depends on individual learning styles and goals. However, a well-rounded approach typically combines several resources:

**Curated Courses/Tutorials:**

* **Codecademy's Python 3 course:** (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)  A popular interactive platform for beginners, Codecademy offers a structured curriculum covering Python fundamentals.

* **DataCamp's Python courses:** (https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/python) DataCamp focuses on data science applications of Python and provides hands-on projects.  Choose a track based on your interests (e.g., data analysis, data visualization).

* **freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python Certification:** (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/)  This is a more advanced option that focuses on using Python for data science and scientific computing tasks.

* **Google's Python Class:** (https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)  A free course from Google focusing on core Python concepts, suitable for beginners.

* **MIT OpenCourseware's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python:** (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/) A comprehensive university-level course available online for free.  It is more challenging, but provides a deep understanding of programming principles.


**Relevant Communities (Optional, as not found in HerKey results):**

* **Women Who Code:** (https://www.womenwhocode.com/) This organization offers various resources and events, including Python-specific workshops and meetups, designed to support women in tech.  Check for local chapters.

* **Stack Overflow:** (https://stackoverflow.com/)  While not exclusively for women, Stack Overflow is a valuable community for asking and answering programming questions.


**Upcoming Events/Webinars (Optional, based on HerKey response; none directly related to Python were found):**

 The provided HerKey API response does not list any Python-specific events. To find relevant events, I recommend searching for "Python for women" or "Python workshops for women" on Eventbrite or similar event listing sites.


Remember to supplement these structured courses with practice. Work on personal projects, contribute to open source projects, or participate in coding challenges to solidify your learning.  The key is consistent effort and practice.
