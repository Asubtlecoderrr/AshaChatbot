Based on your interest in machine learning and your mention of Coursera, I recommend exploring these resources:

**Coursera:** Search Coursera for courses on "Machine Learning," "Python for Machine Learning," and "Deep Learning."  Look for courses from reputable universities and institutions.  Many offer financial aid options.  Focus on courses with hands-on projects to build your portfolio.

**Other Resources:**

* **Kaggle:** Participate in competitions and work on projects.  This is crucial for building a strong portfolio.
* **GitHub:** Create a profile to host your projects and code.
* **YouTube:** While the API call failed, you can still search YouTube for channels and tutorials on machine learning.  Look for channels like Sentdex and 3Blue1Brown (for linear algebra and calculus).
* **DataCamp:** Explore DataCamp's machine learning courses. They offer interactive learning experiences.
* **Udacity:** Udacity also offers nanodegrees and courses in machine learning.
* **edX:** edX provides courses from top universities, many of which are related to machine learning.

**Key Skills to Focus On:**

* **Python:**  Master NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/PyTorch.
* **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Understand regression, classification, and clustering algorithms.
* **Data Visualization:** Learn Matplotlib and Seaborn.
* **Data Wrangling:** Practice cleaning and preparing data.

Remember to tailor your resume and cover letter to highlight your skills and projects.  Good luck with your job search!
